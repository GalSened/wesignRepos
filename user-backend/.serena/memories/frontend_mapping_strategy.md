# WeSign Frontend Mapping Strategy

## Objective
Create comprehensive mapping documentation for the WeSign frontend application that matches the same level of detail as the backend mapping. This includes:

1. **Frontend Architecture Mapping** - Components, pages, routing, state management
2. **Integration Mapping** - Frontend-to-backend API calls, data flow, authentication
3. **Cross-Reference Documentation** - Complete mapping between frontend and backend systems

## Planned Approach

### Phase 1: Frontend Analysis
- Analyze frontend project structure and technology stack
- Document component hierarchy and routing system
- Identify state management patterns and data flow
- Map UI components to their corresponding functionality

### Phase 2: API Integration Analysis  
- Identify all frontend API calls to backend endpoints
- Map frontend services/clients to backend controllers
- Document authentication flow and token management
- Analyze error handling and loading states

### Phase 3: Documentation Generation
- Create frontend comprehensive mapping (similar to backend mapping)
- Generate integration mapping showing frontend-backend connections
- Cross-reference components with their corresponding backend APIs
- Document data transformation and state synchronization

## Expected Deliverables
1. **WeSign_Frontend_Comprehensive_Mapping.md** - Complete frontend architecture documentation
2. **WeSign_Frontend_Backend_Integration_Mapping.md** - Integration points and data flow
3. **Memory Storage** - Store findings for future reference and updates

## Requirements for Analysis
- Frontend project path (to be provided by user)
- Technology stack identification (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)
- Build system analysis (Webpack, Vite, etc.)
- State management library identification (Redux, Zustand, etc.)

## Success Criteria
- Same level of detail as backend mapping (500+ components/features documented)
- Complete API integration mapping with all endpoints covered
- Clear cross-references between frontend and backend systems
- Production-ready documentation for development and maintenance
